description: "The *Structured Feedback* protocol as an interactive addition to the *Web of Data*.
It offers support for users to contribute to the evolution of web resources, by providing structured data artifacts as *patches for web resources*, as well as *simple plain text comments*.
Based on this approach it enables quality assessment and web data cleansing processes by the crowd in an ad-hoc fashion."
